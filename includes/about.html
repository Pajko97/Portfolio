<div class="content-about">
    <p>I am 23 years old Full Stack Developer from Belgrade, Serbia. I always loved computers, but never gone
        the coding way. I saw a post about Javascript and got hooked as soon as I started understanding
        concepts. I am self taught,
        programming for about 3 years
        now with 2 years of professional experience working on complex application. At my job I got to
        lead Frontend and was forced to learn a lot about how apps are built and how to manage people. I am
        comfortable working both remotely and from the office. When I'm not programming I'm mostly listening to rap and
        hanging out.</p>
